## HNET / BITNET
BITNET was a co-operative U.S. university computer network founded in 1981 by Ira Fuchs at the City University of New York (CUNY) and Greydon Freeman at Yale University. BITNET's NJE (Network Job Entry) network protocols, called RSCS, were used for the huge IBM internal network known as VNET. The BITNET protocols were eventually ported to non-IBM mainframe operating systems, and became particularly widely implemented under VAX/VMS, in addition to DECnet.

HNET is [Moshix](https://github.com/moshix)' BITNET compatible network of mainframes (both big iron and emulated), as well as Linux and VAX systems built upon NJE over TCP/IP.

# Other IBM Mainframes (IBM 1401, 1620, 7090/7094, System 3)
Although the original intention of this list was to focus on the IBM System/360 and its descendants, [RattyDAVE](https://github.com/RattyDAVE) reminded me of SimH, which emulates some of IBM's other mainframes, so I am including a section for those machines on this list as well.
## Emulators
* [SimH](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/) ([github](https://github.com/simh/simh)) SimH (History Simulator) is a collection of simulators for historically significant or just plain interesting computer hardware and software from the past. It emulates IBM 1401, 1620, 7090/7094, System 3, as well as many other historical computers.
* [IBM 1401 EMULATOR IN BAL 360 ASSEMBLY](https://github.com/moshix/IBM1401) - An emulator for the IBM 1401 computer, written in BAL360 - intended to work on MVS 3.8
## Software
* [SimH Software Kits](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html) - Various historical operating systems and software to run on your SimH emulated systems.
